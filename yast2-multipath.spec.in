Summary: YaST2 - Multipath Configuration

%description
Multipath I/O is a fault tolerance technique whereby there is more than
one physical path between the CPU in a computer system and its mass
storage devices through the buses, controllers, switches, and bridge
devices connecting them.

You can configure your multipathed devices with this module.
